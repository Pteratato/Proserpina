## Chapter 2: *Polycephaly*

Once again staring into an ornate mirror, Katarina examined her face. She had removed the stage makeup from rehearsal, replacing it with something lighter. She’d been quiet since they’d reached her room, trying to figure out how to side-step her cousin’s request to go outside the wall... 

She eyed the envelope on her vanity a moment, before picking up a comb to hold up the top portion of her heavy locks. 

“So… I got an interesting letter in my fanmail the other day,” Kat mused as she admired the way the rest of her curls fell down her bare back. “There’s this concert venue that hops around the city. And apparently the only way to find it is with a ticket, which one of my *adoring* fans has so generously provided.”

She handed the envelope to her cousin. Inside, Fran found the letter and a small square with a simple caterpillar emblem on it. Kat looked at her cousin, excitement bubbling in her eyes. 

“You take the little slip, let it dissolve on your tongue, and it leads you there,” she said, her eyes wide, a mischievous grin overtaking her lips. 

Without waiting for her cousin to respond, Kat fished out the tiny slip and, with a wide smile, placed it on her tongue. She didn’t know how long it would take to hit her, but that only added to the anticipation.

“*Kat--!*” Fran gasped as she watched her cousin drop the slip on her tongue. “You have no idea what that could be laced with!”

Katarina felt the excitement rush through her veins. There was a small pang of guilt from railroading her cousin into going where she wanted, but it was willed away by the rationalization that Fran would still have a good time. The songstress just didn’t feel like wasting one of her last free nights on a wild caravan chase. And it wasn’t like Amal wouldn’t ever show – Fran would get to moon over him soon enough. 

And who knew, maybe Fran’s mother would let her off easy for missing the family dinner, considering it was almost festival week. Fran had already resolved to miss it anyway, so it wasn’t all on Kat. How important could one dinner be?

“Oh, don’t be a buzzkill. Besides, my mail is checked for anything lethal. This got through the tests because my fans are clever and disguised it as a simple little stamp,” Kat responded confidently. “Now finish getting dressed and enjoy the ride.”

Kat felt the effects of the drug taking hold while her cousin dressed for the night out. The room became an incandescent version of itself, the colors rich but distorted, and the lights became shining starbursts. Hands up, Kat moved her fingers in front of her eyes, watching the shadowy digits dance through the light. 

“Who knew-” she whispered with a giggle, “my fingers are so small and dark!” 

Francesca rolled her eyes, grabbing her cousin by the hand. “We should leave before someone talks to you. If Auntie stops us, we’ll never make it out.”

“Oh, Fran, I love you so much. You’re so beautiful,” the singer said with an airy voice, running her fingers down the sides of her cousin’s face. “Your mind is so beautiful. It’s almost like I can see your ideas spilling out.” 

Nervously, Fran opened one of the doors to Kat’s room, scanning the hallway for any wayward di Norccias. She stepped forward to peek over the railing at the floor below, but the entrance hall was empty. They just might make it out unnoticed. 

“Alright, let’s go,” she whispered, as if that would save them from unwanted attention. 

Kat followed her out of the room, dragging her fingers lightly against the walls. She could almost *hear* the intricate designs of the wall patterns. It was like she was seeing her childhood home for the first time. She never expected that tiny little stamp would open her mind up so much, allowing her to take in the sounds everything made. She’d never been so aware that the carpet held a quiet symphony. That had to be the reason MaMa had spent so much on it! 

There was a small fear in Fran that her cousin may not come down. It was still early but she’d never seen Kat react to any drug this strongly before – and honestly, it was going to get them caught if she couldn’t rein it in! Kat had been babbling about music since they walked out of the room, maybe there was a way to play into that?

“Come along, Kat, there’s more music this way. I bet we could find some of the most amazing music outside the house,” Fran offered hopefully. 

Kat dropped her hand from the banister and looked up at her cousin as if she was an angel offering water to the parched. She smiled and took her cousin’s hand the rest of the way down the stairs. Fran couldn’t breathe until they were on the other side of the front door. 

Quietly, Fran opened the doors to the di Norccia manor, glancing around to make sure there were no staff around. She pushed her cousin out ahead of her and slowly backed out, closing the doors as gently as she could. 

“MaMa!” Kat cried out behind her, with more delight than Fran had ever heard in her life.

Fran turned in horror to see Countessa Carlotta di Norccia, with her daughter hanging from her neck. The di Norccia matriarch had a severe face, with sharp features. She looked much like her daughter, her age only betrayed by the faint lines around her eyes and corners of her mouth.

The countessa was clearly just coming from court. Her gown was her usual mourning black, few adornments but with all the elegance of her station. Her own chocolate waves were pulled from her face in a tight bun, centered at the back of her head. 

“Francesa, Katarina, where are you ladies off to?” the elder woman asked, scanning both girls with a discerning eye. There was a barely noticeable smile threatening the corner of her mouth. 

Fran wracked her brain quickly for a lie, “Oh, we’re just heading to *Casa de Brichese*. Mama has a dinner planned tonight and Kat said she’d help me get ready. I'm great at dressing my cousin but I’m all criss-crossed when it comes to myself!”

The austere matriarch seemed somewhat satisfied with her niece’s explanation for their exit. “And I assume my daughter must have over-indulged in some post-rehearsal relaxation?” she asked, arching an eyebrow at her niece. Kat had not let go of her mother yet – she was enjoying the sound of her mother’s voice singing to her, weaving with the fabrics of the elder di Norccia’s dress. 

“Ah, yes, that’s just it. I told her to forgo that last glass of wine but you know our Kat,” Fran said with a weak smile. “I thought maybe the walk would sober her up some.”

Countessa di Norccia nodded, extricating herself from Katarina’s arms and leading her back to Fran, “Do make sure she gets plenty of water. She has a long week ahead of her and we wouldn’t want our star burning out.”

Fran nodded politely and held on to Kat, watching the matriarch as she closed the door to the house.

“You are insane,” she hissed to Katarina, guiding the songstress briskly down the tree-lined lane. “Absolutely insane, do you know that?”

---

“Fraaaan,” Kat sang playfully, “It’s still working!”

Half an hour later Kat was dancing down the street, arms above her head as she twirled around. Kat could feel herself start to level out, but the high was absolutely still there. She could still hear the songs of the buildings, down to their bricks, and the melodies of the streetlamps and bursts of color that swirled around her, but she was slightly more aware of herself. 

“Woooow,” Kat said as she looked at her hands against the street lamp, “I never noticed how purple my skin is under the streetlights.”

Fran rolled her eyes again at her cousin’s continual fascination with her own hands. It wasn’t the first time she’d played babysitter to the great Katarina di Norccia, and it probably wouldn’t be the last. It wasn’t like she could just leave her cousin to wander around with who-knows-what pumping through her system, and the tablet did seem to do what Kat had said it would. The songstress had immediately seen some kind of invisible message under a street sign, and now they were on some drug-induced scavenger hunt seeking out hidden symbols tucked along the buildings of downtown Octavia. 

It was honestly the wildest outing Fran had had in awhile, and they haven’t even found the venue yet. Needless to say, she’d forgotten all about both Amal and the Brichese family dinner.

Kat was mid-twirl when she suddenly stopped, her dark eyes fixed on a long alleyway lit by a single electric lantern emitting an orange glow. Francesca, unnerved by Kat’s abrupt fixation on the alleyway, stared as well, but saw nothing but a brick wall and some piles of trash. 

“What is it, Kat...?” she murmured hesitatingly. “Another sign?”

The songstress stepped into the alleyway as if hypnotized, lifting her arms towards the wall. 

“Amazing…” she whispered, afraid to dispel the glamour. There, before her eyes, splayed out across the back wall of the alley, was a spray painting of a magnificent Luna moth in flight, the wings a luminescent acid green splayed out in front of a glowing moon. Colors splashed all around it, shades Kat had never before seen, something ethereal and beyond human. A spectrum of twilight hues that seemed to glow with energy, with vibrant life, but none as gloriously as the painted acid-wings of the moth.

Giddiness tempered by a sudden need to *know* what was hidden beneath the awe-inspiring wings, Katarina immediately sought out the entrance with a renewed conviction. It didn’t take long to find a magenta arrow pointing to a stack of empty crates, and Kat shouldered them aside to reveal a cellar door.

Francesca shivered at the sight of it, her apprehension starting to twinge with fear for the first time that evening. She couldn’t see what Kat saw and, for a while, thought perhaps her cousin was having a lark at her expense, but the revelation of the hidden door imparted a different feeling; one of chasing ghosts through the town. 

“This is getting scary,” Francesca said quietly, but Kat pulled up the heavy hatch before Fran could protest further.

Light came from the cellar, and the sound of voices far-off, and music. Exultation spread over Kat’s expression and she began the descent down the stairs.

“What in the world is going on?” Fran whispered behind her cousin, following each footstep carefully. She didn’t quite share Kat’s need for adventure, but the curiosity of this escapade finally had her hooked, and even her good sense couldn’t force her to abandon the adventure now. “What if this is some kind of drug den? What kind of fan invites the Songstress of Octavia to a dingy place like this, anyway?”

“Fran, hush.”

The descent was long and steep, and the air chilled as they traveled further underground, but the muffled sounds of a large gathering of people were comforting. 

The two ladies pushed open a door at the base of the stairs and Katarina gasped at the scene unfolding before her.

The room was a massive, underground storage facility stacked with crates and packed with people, all crowded in this dimly-lit warehouse. Electric lights were placed periodically around the room and hung on the supporting pillars, but did little to illuminate the details of the crowd. The walls were padded as much as possible with heavy drapery and mismatched layers of cloth to help muffle the noise, and they were spray-painted in the same luminescent colors as signs above ground, prominently featuring the character of a huge green caterpillar chasing the moon.

The crowd was thick and rowdy, and more diverse than the ladies had ever seen in a single location. Humans mingled with beastmen of all types, not just the satyrs common beyond the Outer Wall, but caniforms and simians more rare to Octavia as well. More confusing were the headpieces; black masks and leather helmets covered the upper faces of many and frequently sported false horns, ears, or other protrusions. Humans wore animal masks, animals wore human masks, some wore none, and it all undulated together in a confusing array of morphing features.

“Ticket?” A booming voice demanded, lifting a muscled arm to block Katarina’s entry. Overwhelmed and uncomprehending, Kat tore wide eyes from the scene to look at the burly, wolf-masked man, but the shadows of the headpiece kept changing in her eyes and she couldn’t quite focus on it. There was an awkward moment when nobody moved, and then it was Fran who jumped in.

“Oh! Here,” she said, fishing the ticket out of her dress pocket and handing it to the bouncer. Her brow furrowed. “Do you *know* who we are? This here is Ka–”

But the bouncer held up a big palm to silence her.

“No names,” he cut in curtly. “Who you are doesn’t mean shit at the Caterpillar. Masks over there if you want ‘em.” He gestured over his shoulder to a wall full of hanging masks of every creature. “No trouble or I’ll throw you out on your asses.”

Alarm and indignation crossed Fran’s face, but Kat was quick to pull her along. “Let’s take a look at the masks!” she said excitedly. 

Kat enjoyed her fame, reveled in it even. She relished the fanmail and special treatment. She loved being recognized when she was out and loved signing autographs. But there was something interesting about the idea of everyone being anonymous in this club… something interesting about being part of a collective for this night…

No status, no expectations…. 

Only music, movement, body heat. 

The Wall of Masks was fitted with hooks where headpieces of black and brown hung in a disorganized manner. The craftsmanship of these disguises ran the gamut from beautifully embossed leather to scraps of old shoes barely held together by rusted rivets, but they all covered the upper face and followed the theme of beasts and men. Katarina gingerly selected a feathered bird mask from the wall, her fingers brushing the pale leather, but movement from the stage caught her attention.

The stage at the head of the warehouse was the most shrouded part of the room, lit from behind by dimmed electric lanterns so that the faces of the stagehands moving across the platform were cast in shadow. They set up the instruments and checked the speakers, running cables back and forth, and tested the microphone for volume and clarity. Despite poor visibility, it was clear to everyone when the stagehands were replaced by the band members; the quartet moved quietly, but each of their back-lit silhouettes sported a set of tall horns – straight, curved, and twisting.

“Welcome,” a deep voice of gravel spoke into the microphone, “to the *Roaming Caterpillar*.”

Several among the crowd whooped and cheered, so the leader paused. He seemed to be human, dressed in black and metal, with a long braid of orange hair, but his details were obscured by dark shadows and the antelope headpiece.

“To any newcomers here, I am Oryx, your tour guide for the evening,” he continued, his words low and slow, leaving ample room for the crowd to shout back.

“We only have one rule here at the Roaming Caterpillar; anyone who steps over that threshold into this room is a brother or a sister. We do not know race. We do not know status. We don’t give a fuck if you’re therian or human, old or young, Octavian or outlander. Forget all that bullshit. Forget your goddamn name. The Roaming Caterpillar is not a place, it is all of us, a creature with many legs, a creature that can change in the night.”

Cheers rippled through the crowd, and satyrs with cloven hooves stamped against the packed ground until it vibrated.

Katarina was immediately pulled in by the one called Oryx. He had a certain charm… and *god, that voice*. He could be reading a cookbook for all she cared; she was mesmerized.

Oryx pulled back and gestured to his right, where a gray-haired satyr with real horns, pale and twisting, held a sitar. 

“Addax and I are bringing you something a little different this evening, something to introduce us to the newcomers. We are *Polycephaly* and this is our new song, *For Whom Death Stalks*.”

The sitar started first, weaving a slow, forlorn melody, gathering speed like a train taking off with a heavy load. Then its brother, a contemporary guitar, joined in the song, this time deep and ominous but no less melodic. The drums were next, played by Oryx himself, rippling through the chests of the crowd, a second thumping pulse. The vocals were the last to weave through, deep, singing and growling, inviting and monstrous in turns.

*Wandering Wraith,*
*Wasting Dragon,*
*The Kiss of Deliverance,*
*Kisses for the babies, raging fever,*
*Kisses for the children, peeling skin,*
*Kisses for the parents, sucking despair,*
*Kiss for the elders, withering to dust,*
*The Kiss of Reprieve,*
*Wandering Wraith,*
*Wasting Dragon*

Kat had never heard anything like it in her life. It had all the depth and emotion of the opera without the pretentious air. She could feel the music pierce her ribcage and possess part of her that only awakened when she was on stage. There was a sorrow in the words that seemed to escape the songstress as she reveled in the combination of sounds. 

Unamused, Fran groaned loudly, staring at her cousin eyeballing this tall, dark, and weird Oryx guy. Oh, so… *that’s* what they were going to do. Kat was going to wrap herself around the drummer and Fran would have to either follow them or find her way home alone. She wanted to throw her hands in the air and shake her cousin! Katarina wouldn’t know good sense if it kicked her in the stomach. 

The young di Norccia caught the look on her cousin’s face. “Don’t be a party pooper! Now, to mask or not to mask, that is the question.”

Fran wrinkled her nose in distaste, but still selected the mask of a rabbit to fasten around her head. “I’m supposed to be having a nice dinner at home right now,” she complained as she fumbled with the clasp, completely forgetting that *her* plan had been to ride all the way to the Outer Wall. “But, noooo, can’t just have a nice night with Katarina di Norccia involved, gotta throw in some danger, illegal drug use, beastkin, probably some felonies…”

Katarina smiled obligingly, turning her eyes back to the mask she was holding. She held it up towards a dim lantern to get a better look, turning it this way and that. The blue and green feathers suggested it was meant to be a peacock, and the beak was carved with a floral pattern. It was skillfully crafted, and felt like it was meant to be hers. But Katarina rarely traveled anonymously; her power *was* her identity, her family name, and the knowledge that raising a hand against her was essentially treason.

And then there was Oryx, who she was *dying* to know more about. How best to signal her interest?
