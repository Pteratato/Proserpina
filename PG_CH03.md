## Chapter 3: New Acquaintances

Saharkka, the antelope-masked leader of the band *Polycephaly*, moved swiftly in dismantling his drums backstage, packing them up without much thought for organization. In an impromptu venue such as this, ‘backstage’ was nothing more than a poorly lit dirt-walled room, and Saharkka wasn’t a fan of the lack of exit options.

He pulled open a hidden hatch in the floor, where an underground trolley waited, and began to load up their gear.

“You guys were great,” he heard Zale mutter in the background, “I played like shit. I should have changed the chords on that last song before we played in front of people. It ruined the whole fucking song.”

“What are you cryin’ about? I didn’t hear a damn thing wrong with your playing,” responded the oldest among them. “We sounded good tonight and the crowd wasn’t complaining.”

The bickering of his bandmates was usually such a familiar ambience that it didn’t bother Saharkka, but tonight the back of his neck prickled unpleasantly, and he felt on edge, like there was some hidden warning in the air. As always, he packed up anything bearing the *Polycephaly* symbol of the two-headed antelope first.

“You’re just saying that,” Zale carried on. “I know you heard it, Ab. It was crap, I don’t know why anyone lets me touch a guitar.”

“Nah, you’re right, you sounded like shit,” Esther chimed in dryly, packing her bass carefully in its case. “Good thing no one gives a rat’s ass about the backup guitarist. Maybe you should kill yourself already.”

“Shut the *fuck up*,” Saharkka snapped, his voice low but harsh. He turned to face the four of them, gesturing with a drumstick. “Did you fuckers forget *Burning Disciples* got their asses raided by HAREs last week? Esther, get your shit packed up, you’re headin’ back with the trolley tonight. Zale, get the pay, and count it this time. Remember – masks on, stage names only, ‘til we get the fuck outta here. Get everything back to *Underland* in one piece and you can sit around bitching all night if you want.”

“You’re the one not using stage names,” Esther mumbled dourly, but took Saharkka’s place loading the trolley.

Once Zale and Esther had set about their tasks, Saharkka moved to help the satyr with his gear. Absolem was not decrepit, but he was older than the rest of them and Saharkka was protective; *Polycephaly* would be nothing without that second head, after all. 

“Quite an audience tonight,” Absolem mumbled thoughtfully, wrapping a long cable around his weathered hand.

“I don’t like it, Ab,” Saharkka replied. “Word’s gettin’ out.”

Once they were finished, Esther climbed through the hatch with the trolley and gave Saharkka a thumbs up.

“Be careful,” he advised, and closed the hatch. He was shuffling dirt over the hatch with his foot when a heavy knock rapped on the door, and both Absolem and Saharkka tensed.

That bouncer with the wolf mask poked his burly head in.

“Hey,” the gruff man barked over the noise of the crowd. “You got groupies out here, do y-”

The bouncer was cut off by a lithe frame ducking under his arm, impudently entering and scuttling over to the drummer. The wolf-masked man’s mouth opened in surprise, but the woman started talking before anyone could stop her.

“This was my first experience with the *Roaming Caterpillar*,” she gushed. “Without giving too much away, I’ll just say I’ve never heard anything like what you played out there. It’s the first time I’ve felt someone *else’s* music pierce my soul.”

Saharkka glanced at Absolem, who offered a shrug and a half-smile. 

“It’s alright,” Saharkka directed the bouncer, who opened the door the rest of the way to reveal a second young lady, trailing behind the first.

The bold one had long, dark curls and sported a peacock mask, while the other had a shorter bob cut and wore a rabbit mask. Even in the low light, Saharkka could tell they were both well-dressed and moved with a certain elegance uncommon in the underground, and the drummer was glad he and his companion had maintained their own anonymity. 

“Wouldn’t stick around too long, usually doesn’t take long for the fuzz to show up,” the bouncer grumbled before closing the door behind him. 

“Ladies, we’d love to entertain you but we really have to get going,” Ab agreed, not a single twinge of harshness in his tone.

“Wait, wait– I just have a few questions,” the bird woman insisted, while the other tugged on her arm.

“Cousin! You got to meet the band, now let’s go!”

“It’s fine…” the long-haired one replied calmly, glancing at the other. “You can go any time you want.”

The rabbit-masked lady scoffed in disbelief, releasing the arm of her cousin. “Oh, that’s just great, leave me to find my own way home. You know, I get really tired of being a background character in your show!”

The petite rabbit stormed out of the room in a fury, and the bird remained, shrugging a little and turning back to Saharkka. “She’ll be alright, she gets like that sometimes. No sense of adventure, that one.” 

Saharkka scratched a little beneath the antelope mask, cocking his head and glancing at his bandmate.

A contemplative frown tugged at Ab’s lips. He looked at Saharkka, then shuffled a pair of keys out of his pocket and tossed them. The drummer caught them deftly, not needing to ask where Ab was going as he headed out the door.

“But there was something about the composition of the music that really sang to me,” the woman was saying now, her face practically aglow even beneath the mask. “It was layered and complex; percussion is the heart of any arrangement. Without it, the song doesn’t know where it’s going or how fast. Oh, damn, I’m rambling.”

“By all means, ramble away,” Saharkka mumbled, stepping towards the woman and offering her his arm. “You can walk at the same time, right? Tell me about *10th Plague*; too long in the solo?”

–

“Blast that *Kat*.” 

Absolem carefully followed the girl in the rabbit mask. He was old and slow but he could hear the clacking of her well-kept shoes against the cobblestone. The old satyr couldn’t help but be amused by the clear irritation she openly exhibited as he trailed behind her.

She hissed under her breath, chucking the rabbit mask in the bushes as she scurried down the street from the *Roaming Caterpillar*. “Some cousin! What a great friend – why do I go anywhere with her? It always ends with her traipsing off like some floozy with a big, broody, suspicious type who will probably murder her in a basement somewhere!”

“For what it’s worth, Oryx isn’t going to murder your friend. He doesn’t even have a basement,” Ab said, shuffling closer to the young woman, his limp becoming even more pronounced with the click of a cane. “I can’t say he’ll call in the morning but she’ll make it home in one piece.”

The young lady gasped, spinning to face her quiet stalker.

“Look, I can tell by your clean hair and shoes that you’re probably from one of the nicer areas. There are lots of the wrong sort around here; let me help you get home,” Ab offered soothingly, keeping his distance to show he meant no harm. “Name’s Absolem.”

The young lady looked at the old satyr with trepidation. It was clear she was wary of people outside her social status, let alone *beastkin*. But she gave a reluctant nod, her anger still boiling beneath the surface. 

“She do that a lot, then?” Ab said, gesturing his head back towards the club.

“Only every time we go out. I honestly don’t know why I indulge her so much. I know I’m just going to end up finding my own way home alone,” the young girl huffed, crossing her arms over her chest. “I’m Fran, by the way.”

Ah, so complaining about her cousin was enough to keep her distracted. Absolem's amusement only grew. The girl was clearly frustrated – within reason – and her fire reminded him of his own daughter.

“You’re a better cousin than she is, sounds like she doesn’t care much about you,” he said, guiding Fran down the chipped and cobbled street.

Fran sighed. “Ugh, I know it isn’t that she doesn’t care about me. I suppose sometimes I forget how much pressure she’s under. Having such a high station, she has to marry even better than I do, and she’ll be making government decisions one day.”

“Hey now, don’t lose that anger,” Ab said, pointing his cane at her. “She still ditched you for a stranger, and no one’s stranger than my partner. You’ve got every right to be upset, but I get it. It’s normal to want to defend your family.”

“There have been many times when all we had was each other…” Fran trailed off, looking down at the street, the stones glimmering under the lamps. 

There was a pull in the old man’s chest, his dusty heartstrings thrumming to life. He missed his daughter, and he hadn’t thought about her in some time. The old satyr didn’t dare think about her most of the time unless he was alone. She’d been gone so long, he’d almost forgotten what it had been like when she’d been there.

“My daughter used to grasp at every thread to defend me. She was my own personal knight, even though I know I disappointed her more than once,” the beastkin said wistfully. 

Silence stretched between them, filled only by Absolem’s cane clicking on the uneven road. 

“Can I ask why you’re walking me home?” the seamstress asked, puncturing the silence.
 
Absolem sighed. He pulled a long, thin pipe from his waistcoat, taking a puff to get it lit. He supposed he should have been expecting this question at some point. 

“Rich or not, I couldn’t let you walk alone. I know what can happen to young women on these streets.” He paused for a moment, then lifted his mist-colored eyes to meet hers. “I wouldn’t want any parent to go through that. It’s some of the worst pain imaginable.”

Fran could see that pain reflected in the satyr’s eyes, causing her heart to skip a beat, and avert her gaze, unable to look at him. She walked in silence for a moment, keeping the slower pace of the older beastkin.

“....I’m so sorry,” she sniffed finally. “It’s hard to imagine things like that happening in Octavia.”

“In some parts of this paradise there are people living in filth and poverty, and they’ll do anything to get by. And there are some that just have darkness inside that reaches out and consumes everything. Your cousin is safe with my friend, but there *are* brutes out there who would flay her alive just for fun. The government doesn’t make public all the sins that happen in the underbelly of this city,” the beastkin explained darkly. “Bad for commerce, I s’pose.”

A sharp look sparked in Fran’s eye as though she intended to defend the ruling body, but she thought better of it when the large gates that separated Proserpina Gardens from the rest of Octavia came into view. A single guard stood ready to check identification for anyone wishing to enter the district of the aristocracy after hours. 

“I….uh…. thank you for going out of your way to see me safely home. I suppose it’s hard to see all the danger from so high up in my ivory tower,” Fran said resentfully.

It didn’t go unnoticed by Absolem, but he didn’t blame her too much. She’d likely been sheltered from most things and he’d just told her she had no idea what was actually going on in the world. He had called her naive, even. 

Absolem simply dipped his head in her direction and turned, walking back in the direction they’d come from.

In the dim glow of the nocturnal city, two young people stumbled down a steep flight of steps, laughing and touching, basking in the warm, radiant glow of the Octavian lighthouse high above them. The massive pharos towered over the city on the face of the cliff, and though they were not near it, just being in the same district cast everything in a golden light, and the air wafted with Suprex and the scent of the sea.

Waves crashed against the steep cliffside that marked the western edge of the elevated metropolis, and the pair traveled down a flight of stairs carved into the rock itself. Below them, they could see the ships banked in the harbor and the warehouses that never slept, bustling even at this hour with labor, and they could smell the salt and the fishing boats, but they were primarily concerned with each other.

“Over here,” the drummer called *Oryx* said huskily, his large hand guiding Kat by the small of her back. 

He guided her down and around the stairs to a door underneath, which led to a large storage room carved directly into the rock. He unlocked it and led her inside, quickly locking the bolt behind them. It was dark and musty and stacked with crates, but appeared to be very clean. Oryx left her to turn on an electric lantern, setting it on a crate, but quickly returned.

“It’s not fancy,” he breathed, his hands finding their way to her face and her hair as he drew her lips to his. “But I work here sometimes; it’s safe.” 

In that moment, no other explanation seemed necessary. He struggled with impatience as he kissed her, his calloused hands feeling her body through the fabric of her shirt. He pushed her against the cavern wall, one hand on the back of her neck and the other at her waist, his mouth seeking hers as if it contained the very breath of life required to sustain his existence. Kat’s skin was blazing with every touch and caress. She could feel all of his intentions through the delicate fabric, and she couldn’t help but wrap her legs around Oryx.

Their animal masks bumped, and Oryx’ hands fumbled with the buckled strap of the peacock mask to remove it, but his efforts were stopped by a gentle touch from the lady. He looked down at her in confusion, and she just smiled.

“It’s more fun this way,” she said coyly. She shimmied out from between him and the wall, tugging his hand to follow her. 

With her mischievous smile, Kat boldly reached up and slipped Oryx’s mask from his face, sliding her slender hands along his shaved jaw. He was strong-faced and had a scar running under one ear, not at all like the majority of her soft, high-class suitors. His fiery hair was also shaved on both sides, with the top combed back into a braid that trailed all the way down his back. He was curious, if impatient, and he watched her watching him. She smiled and took his hands, slipping them under the hem of her shirt.

“That’s a little unfair, don’t you think?” he complained gruffly.

“Touch me,” she whispered against his ear, feeling his rough hands against her sides. Her own fingers gripping the weathered material of his shirt, nails threatening to shred it. She honestly didn’t care – they could walk home naked if it meant touching every inch of each other right now. She was on fire and wanted him to burn up with her until they were nothing more than smoldering ash. 

She pulled them backwards until she felt the crates hit the back of her knees. Kat held onto Oryx and gave a light giggle and wrapped her legs around his hips again, pulling him to where she sat on the crate.

“Come on, drummer boy, play me a beat,” she whispered against his ear, dragging her teeth along the soft flesh of his lobe. That action seemed to wipe away any hesitation remaining in Oryx, and suddenly he was consuming her, and Kat loved every second. 

In their haste, the pair knocked the lantern to the floor, smashing the electric bulb and leaving them in darkness.
