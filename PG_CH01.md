## Chapter 1: The Songstress

The main dressing room of the lavish *Teatro di Fiore* was cluttered with flowers both fresh and wilting, filling the air with sweet perfume. Gifts and clothes littered the furniture and surfaces around the room, sparing a single couch fated to be buried under layers and layers of fabrics, with swatches of various sizes pinned here and there, seeking out a mythical combination stunning enough to suit the *Songstress of Octavia* herself, Katarina di Norccia.

Katarina tilted her head to the side, causing long, chocolate curls to fall over her shoulder as she looked herself up and down in the mirror. The unusual shape of the crinolette *did* make the silhouette very flattering. She didn’t know why she ever doubted her cousin’s visions; Francesca always came up with exquisite creations. Of course, it was just the bones of the costume, but the structure alone was impressive.

“I don’t know how I could have questioned you – you’ve been fitting me since you could hold a needle and thread,” the songstress said, sending her cousin a sideways glance.

“I keep telling you,” Francesca retorted around a mouthful of faux flower stems, blossoming from the corners of her mouth like a tiny garden. “I am a connoisseur of fashion fabulosity.”

The shorter-haired young lady was seated on the couch amidst the sea of fabrics, her legs tucked under her body and her lap filled with fake flowers, which were strewn about the cushions and floor all around her. In one hand she held a hat, and in the other an embroidery needle, dutifully stitching the flowers and leaves into the fashionable accessory. “Just wait; once the silk caravans arrive, I will find the *perfect* textile for your gown. Amal never disappoints.”

Katarina grinned, swishing slightly in the looking glass. More than anything, singing was her life’s guiding passion, and Kat couldn’t believe she’d made it this far. Fate had definitely been kind to her, and Kat tried her best to be grateful for it whenever possible. Being in the spotlight certainly came with some disadvantages, but that was nothing compared to the reward of doing what she loved for a living. And what was more, she could experience it with Francesca at her side.

“He says I’m his best and *most beautiful* customer,” Francesca continued, clearly pleased with the compliment. “And he always lets me see the textiles before anyone else. Whatever I set my eye on, I buy the whole stock – no one will see your fabrics one single moment before you step onto that stage.”

“Oh, Amal… your once-a-year rendezvous with that silk trader,” Kat teased impishly. “Tell me, Francesca, what *do* you give him in return for such fine fabrics? No holding fees? Nothing to sweeten the pot?”

“Ah!” Francesca flushed red at the implication and threw a bouquet of fake flowers, which bounced harmlessly off the frame of Katarina’s incomplete gown. They both laughed, and then Francesca sighed and shrugged, almost disappointed. “You know me, Kat.”  

Katarina did know. Francesca occasionally had these little crushes, but she would only flirt a little and pine from a distance. She watched her cousin’s reflection and she could see she’d struck a nerve; Francesca stared at her lap but her mind was traveling the sandy dunes with her secret beau.

“I think Conrad is going to formally ask my mother for my hand,” Kat said after a moment, changing the subject to her own struggles with love. The songstress chewed her cheek, and her gaze became distant. She knew Conrad was a smart match, but… Kat didn’t know if she could stomach something *smart* over something *real*. She’d known Conrad since childhood, and she cared about him but she didn’t want to *marry* him. She wasn’t even sure she wanted to marry at all. Her true love was the stage, and the music… couldn’t she just sing until her voice gave out and then live out her retirement in some remote hovel in peace? “He’s nice, and he fits the mold of what Mama would want for me, obedient and well-spoken, but… ugh, I don’t know.”

Francesca snorted and rolled her soft brown eyes. “Has he finally worked up the courage? Not that I can blame him, *I* wouldn’t wanna fight for your mama’s approval.”

Katarina acknowledged that her mother could be a bit… intimidating, to say the least. 

“Conrad used to harass me near daily as a schoolboy for bits and bobs about you to jot down in his stupid little notebook. He’s just so… *boring*.” And Francesca drug out the word *boring* like she was back in primary school herself, sneering at a stupid boy with his stupid notebook. She wrinkled her nose as if something horribly unpalatable had just wafted under it. 

“Exactly – he hasn’t tried to get to know *me*, he’s picked up whatever he could get from you. Countessa’s daughter or not, I don’t want someone who can’t even talk to me. Ma’s scary but any man worth his salt would have the courage to muster up a conversation,” the songstress folded her arms across her chest and paced, biting her lip.

Francesca gave a thoughtful hum, settling her hat and her needle on her lap. 

“I wholly cannot understand, my dear cousin, why our suitors are mired in such mediocrity,” she said. “At least Conrad has a sense of humor. My mother wants me to wed *Wilfred* of all people – can you fathom a more dull human being? Wilfred, really? I’m genuinely starting to believe that our progenitors have bred, stamped, and exiled all creativity and excitement out of the men here, made them as tame as their horses. I swear, I would rather discuss the weather with Amal than the entire history of the world with *Wilfred*. I shudder to imagine spending one day with that man, let alone the rest of my life; I would simply wither away at the inanity of it all.”

Kat nodded sympathetically – Wilfred was perhaps the most drab person she’d ever met, and Francesca’s mother had been pushing her in Wilfred’s direction ever since she was old enough to wed.

“Maybe we should just import some husbands,” Francesca giggled. “I’ll put in an order with Amal for a few… hot young stallions next year. They can model his silks – I might buy the whole caravan.”

“Oh, now that’s an idea! Imported! But what will poor Amal think?” Kat leaned in and poked her cousin on the shoulder. “Do you think they’d be as pretty as the fabrics that come from so far away?”

“Prettier, I’d wager! And in that scenario, my dear, it may no longer matter what Amal thinks!”

The two ladies melted into a fit of laughter, Francesca doubling over her lapful of spring and Katarina leaning heavily on the arm of the couch. They shook with giggles, their tensions and frustrations washed away by mirth. It was the songstress who got herself under control first, and she straightened with her hand pressed to her mouth as the last sounds faded away. She heaved an exhale, then decided that was enough of that. 

“Alright!” She exclaimed breathlessly, clapping her hands together. “I think we’re due for some fun, don’t you?”

“Oh, yes!” Francesca hopped up from the couch in a flurry of flowers. “We’re going to be absolutely *slaving* over this production for next two weeks, let’s squeeze a party in first. What do you have in mind – dancing?” 

“Yes, dancing. And drinking. Depravity. And music. I want to sweat and eat street food, and forget about my impending proposal. Let’s slink our way to the underground and have some fun. We’re starting the festivities early this year, babe!” 

Kat shimmied her shoulders and Francesca made a little twirl, both wearing wide smiles and savoring the idea of a night out on the town. 

“And I have just the hat for the occasion,” Francesca said, picking up the floral hat she’d been stitching and placing it on her own bob-cut hair. “Now let’s have some fun before we’re stuck inside this theater for a fortnight.”

—------------

Typically, the two fashionable maidens would make a final round through the *Teatro di Fiore* before departing from the theater, checking in on the progress of all the departments. Or, more accurately, Katarina would check in and Francesca would shadow her, making comments here and there on the set design or the props or the method acting. They made quite a pair, the two, in some aspects aligned and in some opposed, both young women of wealth and status, always trendsetters and regarded by all with dignity. Katarina outranked her cousin and remained the most desirable bachelorette in Octavia, with her hand promising fortune and fame even among elites. Yet Katarina was distant, sometimes cold, towards these suitors, who were dull and uncreative compared to her burning passion for the arts, and didn’t have a hope of competing with the love she harbored for the stage.
 
Francesca was the only daughter of Countessa Brichese, a noblewoman with the same title but lesser in wealth and land than the illustrious di Norccias. Her hand was still valuable, but her personality was more cloying and pernicious than her cousin’s, and she was known for a certain fickleness towards menfolk. Her parents, somewhat neurotic and over-protective, had ruined young men over the crime of an improper comment or gesture towards their little flower. So the pair of them together, as they often were, attracted the attention of eligible young noblemen wherever they traveled, but rarely did these men act on any ideas of courtship, resolving to cast their line for smaller fish.

Today the pair of young women skipped the rounds in their eagerness and, as usual, though their departure made a bit of a stir, no one impeded their exit with social niceties or overtures of romance. They were grateful for that today, preoccupied with all the unspoken potentials of an exciting evening; bodies closer than propriety allowed, scandalous flirtations to feed the next round of gossip, perhaps even some substances to beguile the senses.

They slipped gaily into a rail carriage, one of many elaborately-designed 4-person carts that carried the aristocracy along a track through Octavia to a specific location. This one was white and green with lavish, gold flora and an elegant script which read; Proserpina Gardens <--> Teatro di Fiore. The rail carriage was not fast, but it was quicker than walking and less arduous than traveling by horseback, plus the privacy of the carriage led to many spilled secrets and conspiratorial whispers.

Francesca sat across from her cousin and smoothed her dress properly, setting her handbag in her lap. She leaned forward, her dark bob bouncing as the carriage started forward along the track, her eyes earnestly fixed on her cousin. Finally, she made her proposition in a low whisper.

“Do you want to go to the outer wall instead?”

“*Francesca*!” Kat gasped a little, both surprised and tickled by the suggestion.

The statement was absurd coming from the lips of the young lady; traveling between Octavia proper and the outer wall required permission and an escort, which would be difficult to obtain without a good reason. The endeavor would likely mean sneaking out through one of the inner gates and hours on horseback across the Octavian countryside, something they hadn’t done in years simply because there was no reason to go. There was nothing at the outer wall, no parties or friends or hot young men, only unnecessary danger.

But the reason was written clearly on Francesca’s face; the caravans were due to arrive any day now, with her admirer among them, and Francesca wished to stand upon the outer wall and see them rumbling down the long road. Amal would be leading the pack, of course, riding a beautiful thoroughbred with the backdrop of the setting sun, and surely he would see her upon the wall and smile….

She’d waste their entire evening for the slimmest chance of that reality.

“Hmm… I don’t know, maybe,” Kat continued hesitatingly, frowning. She didn’t want to break her cousin’s heart, but… well, how likely was it that Amal would even be there? It wasn’t unusual for the caravans to arrive late into the week. “Your mom would be furious, we’ll never get clearance. Anyway, I was thinking something with a little more *excitement*. Let’s find a concert!”

Francesca sighed deeply and seemed about to argue, but… well, Katarina did have a point. She stared at her cousin, a little dejected and unconvinced.

“Or…” Katarina tried again to coax Francesca, “We could go to *Underland*...”

Francesca perked up at that. “Oh, they have the most *amazing* costumes there. Do you think we can… get in... you know, incognito?”

Kat smiled. “Don’t you worry about a thing, my dear, your parents will never– wait a minute, don’t you have a family dinner thing tonight? Auntie will be *pissed* if you miss that.” 

“Ohh, noo! The dinner–!” Francesca collapsed in her seat dramatically, throwing her hands over her head in the universal childish gesture of hiding from her responsibilities. “It’s another suiter, I 
know it is – don’t make me go, Kat! Don’t we deserve some time to ourselves before it’s nonstop work? How can we put on the most extravagant, most beautiful performance of the year if we can’t even get out and tantalize our muses? I can’t deal with another awkward dinner of my parents grilling some poor unsuspecting sap about his family genealogy.”

The songstress nodded commiseratingly, pondering their dilemma. Francesca wasn’t typically the rebellious sort and the Countessa Brichese was quite frightening when angered, but… perhaps just one time, given the circumstances…

“Well, then,” she prodded her cousin, who was still hiding her face under her arms. The familiar scenery passing by outside the cart told her they were now entering Proserpina Gardens, where the city estates of Octavia’s noble families resided. “What do you wanna do?”
